# PP-Mini-Project-Cricket-Data-Analysis
This project is based on the data analysis of cricket players 

We provide the user with a GUI based window made using Tkinter. The user is offered a dropdown box with 11 players out of which he can choose one player at a time.
On selecting the player name, the player's career statistics are displayed in the window and the graphical analysis of his career statistics are showed.

The final working code is stored in final_pp_mini_project.py file
